# WeeWX InfluxDB Integration Testing Progress

## What we've accomplished

1. Successfully installed InfluxDB locally using Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install influxdb influxdb-cli
   brew services start influxdb
   ```

2. Set up InfluxDB with an organization, token, and bucket:
   ```
   influx setup --username admin --password adminpassword --org weewx --bucket weather_data --retention 0 --force
   ```

3. Installed the InfluxDB Python client:
   ```
   python3 -m pip install influxdb-client
   ```

4. Created a test script `test_influx_connection.py` that successfully:
   - Connects to InfluxDB
   - Creates test data
   - Queries the data back
   - Verifies the data was stored correctly

5. Implemented the InfluxDB driver (`influx.py`) with all required functionality:
   - Connection management
   - Bucket (database) creation and deletion
   - SQL to Flux query translation
   - Record insertion
   - Schema handling
   - Error handling
   - Special case handling for SQLite compatibility

6. Created `test_record_insert.py` to directly test inserting WeeWX-like records into InfluxDB.

7. Updated the configuration file to use the InfluxDB driver.

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented core functionality for the InfluxDB driver for WeeWX:

1. **Connection to InfluxDB**: The driver can successfully connect to an InfluxDB 2.x server.
2. **Bucket Management**: The driver can create, check, and drop buckets (InfluxDB's equivalent to databases).
3. **Record Insertion**: The driver can successfully insert weather records into InfluxDB.
4. **Schema Handling**: The driver properly maps WeeWX's schema concepts to InfluxDB's data model, handling fields and tags appropriately.
5. **SQL Translation**: Basic SQL queries are translated to Flux (InfluxDB's query language).
6. **Data Retrieval**: The driver can retrieve data from InfluxDB and convert it to a format WeeWX expects.

## Test Results

### Direct InfluxDB Tests

We've tested the direct functionality of the InfluxDB driver:

- `test_influx_connection.py`: Tests basic connectivity and interaction with InfluxDB.
- `test_record_insert.py`: Tests inserting WeeWX-like records into InfluxDB.
- `check_archive_records.py`: Verifies that records are being stored and can be retrieved.

All of these tests are working correctly. We can connect to InfluxDB, insert records, and retrieve them.

### Integration with WeeWX

When testing the full WeeWX daemon with the simulator driver and the InfluxDB backend:

- WeeWX starts, but we're having difficulty tracking if archive records are being generated. This is not necessarily an InfluxDB driver issue, but more likely a configuration issue with WeeWX itself.

## Current Challenges

1. **WeeWX Integration**: While our direct InfluxDB tests are working, the full WeeWX integration has some issues:
   - The WeeWX process with InfluxDB configuration starts but doesn't output status
   - We need more debugging to understand what's happening during the WeeWX execution

2. **SQL to Flux Translation**: The current implementation has a basic query translation mechanism. We need to enhance this to handle more complex SQL queries that WeeWX might generate.

3. **Schema Evolution**: Since InfluxDB is schemaless, we need to ensure that new fields added to WeeWX's schema are properly handled.

## Next Steps

1. **Debugging WeeWX Simulator**: We need to debug why the WeeWX simulator driver isn't generating archive records. This may involve more detailed logging or checking the WeeWX configuration.

2. **Enhance Query Translation**: Implement more sophisticated SQL-to-Flux translation for queries, especially those involving:
   - Aggregations (MIN, MAX, AVG)
   - Grouping (GROUP BY)
   - More complex time filtering

3. **Stress Testing**: Once basic functionality works, we should test with larger datasets to ensure performance is acceptable.

4. **Schema Optimization**: Review how WeeWX data is modeled in InfluxDB. InfluxDB is optimized for time-series data, and there may be better ways to structure the data.

5. **Unit Tests**: Develop more comprehensive unit tests for the InfluxDB driver.

6. **Documentation**: Complete the documentation on how to set up and use InfluxDB with WeeWX.

## Known Issues

1. **Non-SQL Queries**: The implementation primarily expects SQL-like queries, but WeeWX might use more complex queries that need special handling.

2. **NULL Values**: InfluxDB doesn't support NULL values in the same way as SQL databases, so we skip them during insertion, which might not be ideal for all WeeWX functionality.

3. **Schema Handling**: When a measurement doesn't exist yet, we provide a default schema, but this might not include all needed fields for custom extensions.

4. **Performance Considerations**: We haven't fully optimized for performance, especially for large datasets or high-frequency data collection.

## Testing with the Simulator

To continue testing with the simulator, use the configuration file we created (`weewx-influxdb-test.conf`). You may want to run WeeWX in the foreground with increased logging:

1. Modify the config file to increase logging verbosity
2. Run WeeWX with:
   ```
   python3 src/weewxd.py weewx-influxdb-test.conf
   ```
3. Monitor the InfluxDB data with:
   ```
   influx query 'from(bucket: "weather_data") |> range(start: -1h) |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "archive")'
   ```
4. Use the `test_record_insert.py` script to directly test record insertion if needed:
   ```
   python3 test_record_insert.py
   ```

## Summary

The core functionality for integrating WeeWX with InfluxDB is working. We can connect to InfluxDB, create the necessary database structures, insert records, and retrieve data. The direct tests confirm the InfluxDB driver is working as expected. However, we're still working on ensuring that WeeWX correctly generates and archives records when using the InfluxDB backend in a full production environment.
