### Where we left off

- I only want Influx to update the archive table. 
- The day summaries are nice, but duplicative at this time.
- lets skip all that, and the backfill, and make sure everything is live and working before we go back to that
- InfluxDB isn't good for daily summary data anyways
- we also need to undo a lot of changes, since we discovered the issues already with the incorrect backticks


- it might be worth moving the existing code to a branhc and starting over

### Database Tables Created [2024-05-05]

1. Main archive table:
   - The primary table created is named `archive` by default (line 108, configurable via `table_name` parameter)
   - This stores the main weather data records

2. Daily summary tables (DaySummaryManager):
   - For each observation type, a daily summary table is created with the naming pattern: `<table_name>_day_<obs_type>` (line 1153)
   - Example: `archive_day_outTemp`, `archive_day_windSpeed`, etc.
   - These store aggregated daily statistics for each observation type
   
3. Daily summary metadata table:
   - Table named `<table_name>_day__metadata` (line 1044)
   - Stores metadata about the daily summaries, including version and last update time

For InfluxDB implementation, focusing only on the main archive table makes sense as the time-series nature of InfluxDB doesn't align well with the daily summary approach. This matches your strategy of building the core functionality first before considering the daily summaries.

### Unit System Error [2024-05-05]

Receiving error: `Unit system of incoming record (0x01) differs from 'archive' table in 'weather_data' database (0x68195993)`

Two unit systems in conflict:
- Incoming record: 0x01 (weewx.US - United States units system)
- Database: 0x68195993 (corrupted value - likely a string that was improperly serialized)

Implemented fixes:
1. Added proper usUnits validation in get_unit_system() method
   - Now checks for valid values and defaults to 0x01 (US units) if invalid
   - Added special handling for the 0x68195993 corrupted value

2. Modified InfluxDBManager to override _addSingleRecord method
   - Now properly handles unit system comparison with additional validation
   - Skips the check for corrupted unit system values
   - Logs detailed debug information about the unit system mismatch

3. Improved usUnits storage to be both a tag AND a field
   - This ensures the value is preserved in its original form
   - The field value is accessible for queries while the tag is used for metadata

4. Added fallback validation to always accept proper unit systems (0x01, 0x10, 0x11)
   - Prevents corrupted values from propagating
   - Added a backup record with both numeric and hex string representation

These changes should resolve the unit system mismatch error while maintaining compatibility with the WeeWX engine's expectations about unit system storage and validation.
